# 🚨 QUICK FIX: Get Your Website Working

## ❌ The Problem:
- Your domain `axiee.xyz` shows "This site can't be reached"
- This is NORMAL - the domain isn't configured yet
- We need to deploy to Vercel first

## ✅ The Solution:

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Import**: `Jetsubtc/web`
5. **Click "Deploy"**
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for build

### Step 2: Get Your Temporary URL
- After deployment, Vercel gives you a URL like: `https://web-xxx.vercel.app`
- **This URL WILL WORK** - test it first!

### Step 3: Add Your Domain (5 minutes)
1. In Vercel dashboard → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. **Add Domain**: `www.axiee.xyz`
3. **Configure DNS** as shown by Vercel
4. **Wait 30 minutes** for DNS propagation

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### After Step 1 (Vercel Deployment):
- ✅ Temporary URL works: `https://web-xxx.vercel.app`
- ✅ Your website is live (just not on your domain yet)

### After Step 2 (Domain Configuration):
- ✅ `www.axiee.xyz` works
- ✅ SSL certificate active
- ✅ Professional hosting

## 🔧 If You're Still Having Issues:

### Check Your Domain Provider:
1. **Who is your domain provider?** (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. **Access your domain dashboard**
3. **Add DNS records** as shown by Vercel

### Common DNS Records:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.19
```
